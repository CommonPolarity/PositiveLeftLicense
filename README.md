# Positive Left License v2.1
The **Positive Left License** is a license I created initially for my website. It is relatively simple in it's goals:
- To promote copyleft ideals similar to the GPL
- Allow for proper action to be taken against discriminatory and defamatory content
- Promote a healthier and better internet in general for creators

Feel free to use it. It's here for **anyone**. Best suited for sites in my opinion.
